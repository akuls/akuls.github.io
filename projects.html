        			<b class="sub_heading">Cricket score adjustment using ML</b>
	    			<br>
	    			<i>Mar 2017 - Apr 2017</i>
	    			<br><br>
	    			Here, we focus on prediction in a specific scenario. One where the team batting second in a limited overs game is interrupted by rain. In such a case, there is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckworth%E2%80%93Lewis_method">Duckworth-Lewis</a> method which takes into account, the overs remaining and wickets-in-hand as the two resources. Based on these, it predicts an adjusted target to be chased down once the play has resumed. However, it is evident that wickets are worth more than overs and there are other factors like venue, powerplay, momentum, etc that can affect the performance of a team. We hope to take these factors into consideration and perform a more accurate score adjustment.

	    			<b class="sub_heading">Manuscript PDF Parsing and Labelling</b>
	    			<br>
	    			<i>Feb 2017 - Apr 2017</i>
	    			<br><br>
	    			The task involves identifying and extracting elements from the PDF file including title, abstract, authors, affiliations, and references. We will leverage existing PDF parsing technology that provides detailed information about the text and formatting of the manuscript. We then employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field">conditional random field</a> and advanced deep learning techniques to accurately label and extract the metadata to allow further downstream processing.

	    			<br>
	    			<i>Feb 2017 - Apr 2017</i>
	    			<br><br>
	    			We hope to provide an in-depth comparison between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgresSQL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB">MongoDB</a> databases. We take into account, the effect of- size of data, indexes, complex queries, multi-threading and other factors on the query run time. We are using Python to carry out the analysis. At the end of it, we hope to summarize the scenarios appropriate for usage of a specific type of database.

	    			<br>
	    			<i>Oct 2016 - Dec 2016</i>
	    			<br><br>
	    			This project involves the suggestion of appropriate infobox templates to Wikipedia articles. Given a Wikipedia article, we try to answer two questions: Does a page require an infobox? If yes, what is the appropriate infobox to use for this page? We cast these questions as classification tasks and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">linear SVMs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">Decision Trees</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forests</a> in our solutions. Other tools we are using include spaCy and scikit-learn.

	    			<br>
	    			Cisco Systems | <i>Dec 2015 - Apr 2016</i>
	    			<br><br>
	    			Designed and developed a Business Capacity Management System that automates the complete process of Capacity Management. This involved
		    		real-time tracking of customer activity using CPU, RAM, Mount-point and DB-Space usage followed by trend generation of available v/s utilized infrastructure.
					Prediction of the capacity usage per customer at a future time which aided pro-active decision making with regard to allocation/de-allocation of resources.
					This eventually helped prevent application overload and also optimized the overall cost involved. The system is currently in production. 
					Technologies used: Python 2.7, MySQL, HTML, PHP, CSS, JQuery.

	    			Morgan Stanley | <i>May 2015 - Jul 2015</i>
	    			<br><br>
	    			Designed and developed a solution in Java to automate Report Filing for US and EU clients.
	    			Input- Customer financial report in Excel format. Output- An XML file ready to be uploaded on the report filing website. 
					Excel -> CSV -> XML was the flow followed.
					Fast tree traversal was done on the DOM structure to efficiently construct the XML.Supplanted the manual task and reduced effort from several hours to 1-2 minutes.
					Developed a simple portal to analyze the performance of the tool over time. Technologies used: Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Angular JS.
